# Resonant Ranch Labs Website

This repository contains a speculative interactive website for the "Make-Your-Own-Steak Machine"—a techno-moral concept aimed at decarbonizing meat production while honoring animal welfare and farmer livelihoods.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page with narrative storytelling, techno-ethical framing, and interactive components.
- `styles.css` – Visual system featuring neon gradients, glassmorphism cards, and responsive layout rules.
- `script.js` – Enhances interactivity (tabbed walkthroughs, impact lens switching, resource simulator, animated background, smooth scrolling).
- `website-script.md` – Pre-build content plan covering copy, layout intent, and multimedia notes for each section.

## Viewing Locally

You can launch a simple static server from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
